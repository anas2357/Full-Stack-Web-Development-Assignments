In CSS, relative positioning means an element is moved from its usual position, but it stays in the flow of the webpage. It's like saying, "Move a bit from where you normally would be, but keep your space so other elements around you don't get too bothered."

On the other hand, absolute positioning is like telling an element, "Go to a specific spot, but forget about where you were supposed to be. You won't take up any space, and things around you might adjust to fill the gap you left."
