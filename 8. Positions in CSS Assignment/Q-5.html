<!-- In CSS, the z-index property controls the stacking order of elements along the z-axis, determining which elements appear in front or behind others. Elements with a higher z-index value appear in front of those with lower values. It's like arranging sheets of paper on a desk; the higher the z-index, the closer the element is to the viewer, making it visible on top of elements with lower z-index values. As we can see in this example when element A has higher Z-index it appears on top of B element and vice-versa when A's Z-Index is higher -->
