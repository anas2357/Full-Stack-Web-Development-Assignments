Purpose of comments in HTML is to leave some message for future editor
of the code in an html file. A part of code is commented by placing starting
tag "<!- -" and ending "- ->" (without space) respectively at beginning and 
ending tag of the code that has to be commented. The browser ignores the text
that is commented and doesn't render it on the webpage.
  
  For Example:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- <h1>This header won,t be rendered on web page</h1> -->
        <!-- <p>This paragraph Won't be rendered as well, but the next editor
        of the code will be able to read what i have commented here </p> -->
    </body>
    </html>
