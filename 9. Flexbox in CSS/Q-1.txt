Flexbox is great for arranging items in a row or a column, making it perfect for things like navigation menus. On the other hand, Grid is awesome for creating overall page layouts with rows and columns, giving you precise control over both dimensions. If you're working with a one-dimensional layout, go for Flexbox. If you need a two-dimensional layout with rows and columns, Grid is the way to go. In many cases, using both together can give you a powerful toolkit for designing flexible and responsive websites.
