                HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, 
                is the standard markup language used to create and 
                structure content on the World Wide Web. It forms 
                the backbone of web pages and is essential for building 
                the structure and layout of information that browsers 
                render.

                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles HTML elements, 
                providing layout and presentation. It uses selectors, 
                declarations, and layout models to control how web 
                pages look on different devices, fostering responsive, 
                visually appealing designs.

                JavaScript is a versatile scripting language for web 
                development. It adds interactivity, dynamic content, 
                and behavior to HTML and CSS. Widely used in both front-end 
                and back-end development for creating interactive and 
                feature-rich web applications.

            <p>
                Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime, enabling the 
                execution of JavaScript code outside browsers. It's efficient, 
                sc/alable, and commonly used for building server-side 
                applications and APIs, thanks to its event-driven, non-blocking 
                architecture.

                MongoDB is a NoSQL database system, storing data in flexible, 
                JSON-like documents. It's widely used for its scalability, 
                flexibility, and speed. MongoDB is a key player in modern web 
                development, especially for handling large datasets and 
                dynamic content.
